Summarization App  —  Summary



This project builds a simple, extractive text summarization desktop app using Python, NLTK, and Tkinter. It focuses on classic NLP preprocessing and a straightforward sentence scoring method to select the most informative sentences from any input text.

What the app does step by step:

Imports NLP and GUI libraries (NLTK for processing; Tkinter for the interface).

Initializes a WordNet lemmatizer to reduce words to their base forms.

Defines summarize_text, the core function that:

Validates input (handles empty text and missing sentences gracefully).

Splits the input into sentences and tokenizes each sentence into words.

Removes English stopwords and non-alphabetic tokens to keep meaningful terms.

Lemmatizes remaining words and builds a frequency table counting important terms.

Scores each sentence by averaging the frequencies of its informative words (normalizes by word count to avoid favoring long sentences).

Ranks sentences by score and returns the top N (default 3) concatenated as the extractive summary.

Sets up a Tkinter GUI:

A text area to paste or type content.

A “Summarize” button wired to call summarize_text.

An output area that displays the resulting summary.

Key behaviors and design choices:

Extractive approach: selects existing sentences from the input; does not generate new text.

Frequency-based scoring: prioritizes sentences containing frequent, lemmatized keywords after removing stopwords.

Robustness: provides helpful messages for empty inputs or texts without valid sentences.

Simplicity: no external models or deep learning—easy to understand and extend.

How to extend or customize:

Add a control (slider/dropdown) to choose summary length dynamically.

Improve scoring with TF-IDF weighting to downweight very common terms across documents.

Reduce redundancy by penalizing highly similar sentences in the top-N selection.

Incorporate title/first-sentence bias for better lead summaries.

Add basic text cleaning (e.g., handling numerics, punctuation, casing) or language selection for stopwords.

Practical notes:

Ensure NLTK data packages are available (punkt, stopwords, wordnet).

The default window size and widget dimensions are set for a compact interface; adjust as needed.

For longer inputs, consider adding progress feedback or asynchronous execution to keep the UI responsive.
