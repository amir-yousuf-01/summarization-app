ðŸ“‘ Full Project Summary: Text Summarizer

This project is a Text Summarization Tool built with Python, NLTK, and Tkinter. It uses extractive summarization techniques to identify and return the most important sentences from a given text. The GUI allows users to paste any text, click Summarize, and instantly view a concise version.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Uses tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization for text processing.

Extractive Summarization: Selects top-scoring sentences based on keyword frequency.

Customizable Length: Returns a summary of configurable sentence count (default: 3).

Error Handling:

Empty input â†’ prompts user.

No valid sentences â†’ handled gracefully.

GUI Interface:

Built with Tkinter and ScrolledText widgets.

Simple, interactive, and user-friendly design.

ðŸ”¹ How It Works (Step-by-Step)

User pastes or types text into the input box.

Text is tokenized into sentences and words.

Stopwords are removed to focus on meaningful words.

Words are lemmatized (reduced to base form).

A frequency table is built to score keywords.

Each sentence is scored based on keyword frequency.

The top N sentences (most relevant) are extracted.

Final summary is displayed in the output box.

ðŸ”¹ Why Itâ€™s Useful

Shows how NLP techniques like tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal can be applied.

Demonstrates extractive summarization in a simple and visual way.

Great example of combining NLP + GUI programming.

Beginner-friendly but highlights real-world applications of text summarization.
