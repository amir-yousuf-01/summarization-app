# summarization-app
A lightweight, extractive text summarization app built with NLTK and a Tkinter GUI. It tokenizes input text into sentences and words, removes English stopwords, lemmatizes tokens, builds a word frequency table, scores each sentence by normalized keyword frequency, and returns the top N sentences as the summary via a simple desktop interface.
